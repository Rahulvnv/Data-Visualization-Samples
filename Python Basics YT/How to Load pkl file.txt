The file for BVB Events is in pkl format unlike the csv type as csv files that are big
are generally converted to Pickle (pkl) file format.
Do not worry, all you have to do is do the following steps:
import pandas as pd
data=pd.read_pickle('Pickle_file_you_want_to_read.pkl)
Then you will have the File like you saw in the Video
If you want to save it to csv then just use data.to_csv('My_csv_file.csv')
